An Amazon EC2 Dedicated host is a physical server with EC2 instance capacity dedicated for your use and allows you to reliably launch EC2 instances on the same Dedicated host over time. You have visibility over how your Dedicated hosts are utilized and you can determine how many sockets and cores are installed on the server. These features allow you to minimize licensing costs in a bring-your-own-license (BYOL) scenario and help you address corporate compliance and regulatory requirements.
